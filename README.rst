This is a simple Python project that offers **stock investment recommendations** based on **Machine Learning** predictions from last year's values of any market symbol and also based on **Twitter sentiment analysis** from retrieved tweets containing the symbol as text inside of it.

Requirements
------------

Once you have installed the packages, you will need to create a file inside the project folder named **constants.py** that has to look like this:


.. code:: python


  consumer_key = ''
  consumer_secret = ''
  access_token = ''
  access_token_secret = ''

  num_of_tweets = int()
  
  
This file contains the API keys from **Twitter**, that you can get from `Twitter Developer Platflorm <https://developer.twitter.com>`_ applying for them using you own Twitter account, and the number of tweets you want to retrieve for the sentiment analysis.

Explanation
------------

To check if the stock symbol introduced via prompt is **valid** (or if it exists) I check if it appears in a `Company List CSV <./companylist.csv>`_ that contains every stock symbol available:


.. code:: python


  flag = False
  df = pd.read_csv('companylist.csv', usecols=[0])

  while flag is False:
      symbol = raw_input('Enter a stock symbol to retrieve data from: ').upper()
      for index in range(len(df)):
          if df['Symbol'][index] == symbol:
              flag = True
              
      
      
Now, the next step is to create the **Pandas DataFrame** of the introduced symbol stock market values from the last year from now. The information is retrieved from **Yahoo! Finance** using `yahoo-finance-fix <https://github.com/ranaroussi/fix-yahoo-finance>`_.
 

.. code:: python


  actual_date = dt.date.today()
  past_date = actual_date - dt.timedelta(days=366)

  actual_date = actual_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  past_date = past_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

  data = yf.download("AAPL", start=past_date, end=actual_date)
  df = pd.DataFrame(data=data)
 
 
Once the **DataFrame** is created, I start modelling it to use the prediction algorithms from **scikit-learn**, in this case I will use LinearRegression because it has a nice accuracy score overrall, but if you want you can use almost any of the regression algorithms for stock precition listed in `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning>`_.

Fist I set up the model for the forecast:
 

.. code:: python


  df = df[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
  df['HighLoad'] = (df['High'] - df['Close']) / df['Close'] * 100.0
  df['Change'] = (df['Close'] - df['Open']) / df['Open'] * 100.0

  df = df[['Close', 'HighLoad', 'Change', 'Volume']]

  forecast_col = 'Close'
  forecast_out = int(math.ceil(0.01*len(df)))
  df['Label'] = df[[forecast_col]].shift(-forecast_out)
  
  
Then I apply a preprocessing to the X values, that are the original values of the **Close** ones, but without the forecast out values, that are shifted up to the 10% of the whole dataset. So on I apply the cross-validation algorithm to establish the X and y values for trainning (20%) and testing.


.. code:: python


  X = np.array(df.drop(['Label'], axis=1))
  X = preprocessing.scale(X)
  X_forecast = X[-forecast_out:]
  X = X[:-forecast_out]

  df.dropna(inplace=True)
  y = np.array(df['Label'])

  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
  
  
Finally I apply the LinearRegression algorithm to the data set and then I plot it to see the representation of the forecast made.


.. code:: python


  clf = LinearRegression(n_jobs=-1)
  clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
  accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
  forecast = clf.predict(X_forecast)

  df['Prediction'] = np.nan

  last_date = df.iloc[-1].name
  last_date = dt.datetime.strptime(str(last_date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

  for pred in forecast:
      last_date += dt.timedelta(days=1)
      df.loc[last_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")] = [np.nan for _ in range(len(df.columns) - 1)] + [pred]

  df['Close'].plot(color='black')
  df['Prediction'].plot(color='green')
  plt.legend(loc=4)
  plt.xlabel('Date')
  plt.ylabel('Price')
  plt.show()
  
  
For example, for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** the prediction plot looks like this:


.. image:: https://i.gyazo.com/29121a2a8d0b1a87d0ad0870fb8224ec.png


Once the stock prediction has finished, the **Twitter sentiment analysis** starts and it retrieves a list of the last 100 tweets posted in english containing the symbol introduced and they are later stored in a list of Tweet class, defined in `Tweet.py <./Tweet.py>`_ with the tweet's text and polarity from TextBlob.


.. code:: python


  auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(ct.consumer_key, ct.consumer_secret)
  auth.set_access_token(ct.access_token, ct.access_token_secret)
  user = tweepy.API(auth)

  tweets = tweepy.Cursor(user.search, q=str(symbol), tweet_mode='extended', lang='en').items(ct.num_of_tweets)

  tweet_list = []
  global_polarity = 0
  for tweet in tweets:
      tw = tweet.full_text
      blob = TextBlob(tw)
      polarity = 0
      for sentence in blob.sentences:
          polarity += sentence.sentiment.polarity
          global_polarity += sentence.sentiment.polarity
      tweet_list.append(Tweet(tw, polarity))

  global_polarity = global_polarity / len(tweet_list)
  
  
Now, to make the **recommendation** I check if the prediction was favorable compared to the last non-predicted value and if it is, then the global polarity is checked and if it is positive (>0.0 according to TextBlob values), the system recommendation is to invest in that symbol, if not, the recommendation is not to invest.


.. code:: python

  
 if df.iloc[-forecast_out-1]['Close'] < df.iloc[-1]['Prediction']:
  if global_polarity > 0:
      print("According to the predictions and twitter sentiment analysis -> Investing in %s is a GREAT idea!" % str(symbol))
  elif global_polarity < 0:
      print("According to the predictions and twitter sentiment analysis -> Investing in %s is a BAD idea!" % str(symbol))
 else:
  print("According to the predictions and twitter sentiment analysis -> Investing in %s is a BAD idea!" % str(symbol))
